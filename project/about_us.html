			  <p>About The Pet Matchmaker! </p>
			  <p class="text_small"><strong>Here at The Pet Matchmaker, we know that rescue pets make the BEST pets.  </strong></p>
			  <p class="text_small">We want everybody to know that. And we want to share stories and experiences of the people who already know it. There are thousands of heroes out there doing the very important work of rescue, foster and adoption. We want to tell their stories and trumpet their accomplishments! And, if we can inspire more people to take just one of these steps, we know that a homeless pet&rsquo;s life will be saved. And a human&rsquo;s life will be enriched beyond measure. Win. Win.</p>
			  <p class="text_small"><strong>The sad fact is that animal shelters in the United States are overcrowded and underfunded.</strong> Thousands of animals are euthanized (put to death) every year. The Pet Matchmaker is out to help change that fact. We want to be a part of the solution.</p>
			  <p class="text_color">A Message From Our Founder:</p>
			  <p class="text_small">Hello. I&rsquo;m Elaine Hendrix, aka The Pet Matchmaker. It&rsquo;s my great honor to be in animal advocacy for over a decade. After I made what I call the &ldquo;fortunate mistake&rdquo; of watching an undercover fur video, it changed my life forever. I travel all over the world. I have discovered that – much like myself before that video – people love animals, but have no idea what is actually happening to them.</p>
			  <p class="text_small">Even if people who do understand the challenges animals face, often they have no idea how to help.</p>
			  <p class="text_small"><strong>As The Pet Matchmaker, it&rsquo;s my goal to be part of the solution to that problem.</strong></p>
			  <p class="text_small">To that end, an incredible team of people joined me in creating this site to inspire and celebrate the foster, rescue and adoption of homeless pets, everywhere.</p>
			  <p class="text_small">A little inspiration makes a big difference! If you&rsquo;ve already got a rescue pet, we&rsquo;ve got stories that celebrate people just like you. If you&rsquo;re thinking of getting involved in rescue, foster or adoption, we want to inspire you! So come on in, poke around. Visit regularly. We update pages often. I&rsquo;m thrilled to share this journey with you!</p>
			  <p class="text_small"><strong>Creating happily ever after…one pet at a time,</strong></p>
